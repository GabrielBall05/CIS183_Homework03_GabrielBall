About the program/How to use it: Main page shows a list of all employees currently in the database. To view an employee's
information, click on their name in the list. To delete an employee, long click their name on the list. This will bring
you to a new page asking you if you are sure that you want to delete this employee. Clicking no will take you back and NOT
delete the employee, clicking yes will take you back and DELETE the employee. Back on the main page, clicking "Add Employee"
will bring you to a new page where you insert the information of an employee you wish to add. All text boxes must be filled
and the username must be unique. If not, an error will show telling you what you did wrong. On this page, clicking "Add" will
add the employee to the database and bring you back to the main page where you can see your newly added employee. Clicking "Back"
will take you back to the main page without adding the employee. Back on the main page again, clicking "Update Employee" will
take you to a new page where you can update the information of an employee. You can click "Back" to go back to the main page
without updating the employee. On this page, you must fill out the employee's username and click "Check if employee exists." If
there is no employee with that username, an error will show telling you so. If an employee does exists with that username, both
the button and the text box will be disabled. Text boxes will appear and that employee's information will then be automatically
filled out. User can change information in any of those text boxes and then click "Update." If any of the text boxes are empty,
an error will show telling you to keep all fields filled out. Clicking "Update" will update that employee's information and take
you back to the main page where you can once again see the (updated) list.

Issues I ran into: None that I couldn't figure out.
The hardest part was figuring out how I want to pass things from one intent to another
